# Plugin semantics and gotchas

The parts of writing a Torana plugin that are not obvious from the ABI: how the
protobuf payload must be decoded, how each hook actually behaves, and two classes
of bug that are silent by construction.

Start with [WRITING_A_PLUGIN.md](WRITING_A_PLUGIN.md) if you have not written one
yet.

This guide is designed to help engineers and AI agents implement Torana WASM plugins robustly, avoiding common pitfalls related to the Torana plugin architecture, Go's WASI integration, and JSON serialization.

## 1. WASI Build Mode

Torana uses `wazero` for executing WASM plugins. For standard Go (not TinyGo), compiling to `wasip1/wasm` with standard commands yields a command-oriented execution model, which means the runtime shuts down after `main()` completes. This breaks `Torana`'s hook-based reactor execution model where Torana calls exported functions multiple times.

**CRITICAL:** Always compile your standard Go plugins as a C-shared library to enable the reactor model.
```bash
GOOS=wasip1 GOARCH=wasm go build -buildmode=c-shared -o plugin.wasm .
```

**Plugin binaries are build artifacts and are NEVER committed to git** (`*.wasm`
is gitignored). Torana logs a warning at load time if `plugin.wasm` is older
than the plugin's Go sources, and tells you to reinstall that plugin.

Where you rebuild depends on which repository you are in: `make testdata` builds
torana-edge's test fixtures, `./scripts/build.sh <plugin>` builds a bundle in
torana-plugins, and `torana plugin install` builds from source and prints the
digest for anything installed. There is no longer a target that builds "all
plugins" from one place — they live in their own repositories.

## 2. Protobuf Structure and Torana's Payload

Torana uses a strict Protobuf contract for all WASM boundaries to prevent schema corruption.
When Torana invokes `run_before_request`, it passes serialized bytes of `pb.ChatRequest`. 

The Go plugin SDK handles all the underlying memory allocation, pointer packing, and Protobuf marshaling for you.

**CRITICAL:** Do NOT attempt to read raw JSON or use `map[string]any`. You will lose the benefits of Protobuf unknown field preservation.

### The Correct Unmarshaling Pattern

Use the generated `pb` types and the `sdk` handlers. The SDK automatically unmarshals the request and marshals the response, fully preserving unknown fields under the hood.

```go
package main

import (
	"context"
	sdk "github.com/torana-edge/torana-plugin-sdk"
	"github.com/torana-edge/torana-plugin-sdk/pb"
)

func main() {
	sdk.OnBeforeRequest(func(ctx context.Context, req *pb.ChatRequest) (*pb.ChatRequest, error) {
		modified := false

		// Extract and modify the fields you care about
		if len(req.Tools) > 0 {
			// modify req.Tools...
			modified = true
		}

		// Short-circuit if no modifications are needed
		if !modified {
			return nil, nil
		}

		// Return the modified request
		return req, nil
	})
}
```

## 3. Stream Hooks: Suppress, Replace, Fan-Out

`run_on_stream_chunk` handlers return a `*pb.StreamEventResult` describing
what replaces the input event. Use the SDK helpers:

| Helper | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `sdk.Pass()` (or `nil`) | forward the event unchanged |
| `sdk.Suppress()` | drop the event from the stream |
| `sdk.Replace(ev)` | substitute the event |
| `sdk.Emit(ev1, ev2, …)` | fan out multiple events in its place |

The canonical buffering pattern — reassemble fragmented tool-call arguments,
process them once, and emit a single complete delta:

```go
sdk.OnStreamChunk(func(ctx context.Context, chunk *pb.StreamEvent) (*pb.StreamEventResult, error) {
	if td := chunk.GetToolCallDelta(); td != nil {
		bufferFragment(td) // via env.meta_set — state is request-scoped
		return sdk.Suppress(), nil
	}
	if te := chunk.GetToolCallEnd(); te != nil {
		full := processArgs(assembleFragments(te.Index))
		// Fragments were suppressed, so the complete args MUST be emitted
		// here, followed by the ToolCallEnd itself.
		return sdk.Emit(deltaEvent(te.Index, full), chunk), nil
	}
	return sdk.Pass(), nil
})
```

**State scoping rules:**
- `env.meta_set` / `env.meta_get` — plugin-private AND request-scoped. Other
  plugins and other requests can never see these keys. Setting an empty
  value deletes the key.
- `env.cache_set` / `env.cache_get` — shared across plugins and requests
  (with a TTL). Use for cross-request handoff, e.g. the compactor caches
  intents by `tool_call_id` that the keyword_compactor reads next turn.

## 4. Response Hooks: `run_after_response` semantics differ by path

`run_after_response` fires on **both** response paths, but with **asymmetric**
mutation semantics — know which one you're on before relying on it:

| Response path | Mutations (assistant content, tool-call name/args) |
|---|---|
| Non-streaming JSON | **Applied** — written back into the response body before the client sees it (`internal/proxy/jsonresponse.go`). |
| Streaming SSE | **Observational only** — the hook runs *after* the stream has already been serialized to the client, so any mutation is discarded (`internal/proxy/server.go`). |

**Why:** buffering an entire SSE stream to allow post-hoc rewrites would defeat
streaming latency, so the streaming path invokes the hook purely for observation.
This is the right channel for **metrics / audit / usage** plugins (e.g. `otel`),
which only read the `_response` signal (latency, upstream status, token usage).

**If your plugin needs to *rewrite* the final response**, do it on the streaming
path via `run_on_stream_chunk` (mutate events as they flow — see §3), not
`run_after_response`. Torana logs a heads-up at load time for any plugin that
declares `run_after_response`, reminding you the streaming mutations are dropped.

## 5. Background Hooks: `run_on_tick` has no request

`run_on_tick` is the only hook that fires when nothing is passing through the
proxy. That makes it the only place a plugin can act on elapsed time — and it
means most of what a plugin normally relies on is simply absent.

| Host call | Inside a request | Inside a tick |
|---|---|---|
| `env.meta_get` / `env.meta_set` | per-request scratch space | **empty** — there is no request to scope to |
| `env.original_request` | the caller's pristine request | **empty** |
| `env.original_response` | the raw upstream body | **empty** |
| `env.plugin_config` | your config | your config |
| `env.cache_get` / `env.cache_set` | shared, cross-request | shared, cross-request |

There is also **no caller credential**. Host calls that would normally fall back
to the caller's own API key have nothing to fall back to, so anything a tick
sends must be authenticated by provider-level configuration. A tick that assumes
otherwise fails as a silent 401, not as an error you can see.

The practical consequence: **anything a tick needs must already be in the
plugin's own durable state**, written there during an earlier request hook, or
obtainable from a host call that resolves its own configuration.

Two more things:

- **Set `handled = true`** on any `TickResult` you mean. An all-defaults message
  encodes to zero bytes, which the host reads as "did nothing". Return `nil` when
  there genuinely is nothing to do.
- **`failure_mode` does not apply.** It selects whether a failing plugin blocks
  or passes *the request*, and there is no request. A trapping tick is logged and
  the other plugins' ticks continue.

Ticks require the `env.background_tick` permission and are off unless the
operator also sets `plugins.runtime.tick_interval_seconds`. Both are deliberate:
code running outside any request is work an operator cannot see in a trace, and
it may spend their money.

## 6. Prompt-Cache Compliance

Provider prompt caching bills cached input tokens at ~10% of full price — it is
the single biggest cost lever an agent session has, and a plugin can silently
destroy it. Two rules keep a plugin compliant:

**1. Never strip cache breakpoints.** `Message.cache_control_json` and
`ToolDef.cache_control_json` carry the client's cache markers (Anthropic
`cache_control`, Bedrock `cachePoint`) through the plugin boundary. They
survive automatically — a plugin that returns a request keeps them without
doing anything. But a plugin that *restructures* messages (splits, merges,
reorders, drops) must carry the marker to the equivalent position in its
output. The SDK helpers do this:

```go
cc := sdk.CacheControl(msg)          // read a message's breakpoint (nil if none)
sdk.SetCacheBreakpoint(msg, cc)      // attach / clear one
sdk.MoveCacheBreakpoint(from, to)    // transfer when merging messages
```

**2. Be deterministic over the cacheable prefix.** Everything before the last
breakpoint — tools, system prompt, conversation history — must serialize to
the *same bytes* on every request that replays the same history. OpenAI
caching is an exact-prefix match (one changed token busts it); Anthropic
hashes the rendered prompt up to each breakpoint. Concretely:

- No wall-clock time, randomness, request IDs, or counters in anything you
  inject before a breakpoint.
- Any value derived for a *historical* message must be a pure function of
  that message (the intent plugin's heuristic fill once mixed in a snippet of
  the latest user message — every turn re-serialized the same history to
  different bytes, busting the cache from that point on; it now derives only
  from the call's own name+args).
- One-time changes are fine: the first compaction of a tool result re-caches
  once and then stays stable (keyed by content, tool arguments, intent, and
  policy version) — a potential net win after rewrite cost. What's
  fatal is *per-turn* variance.
- Per-request state belongs in `ToranaMetaJson` (never serialized to the
  wire), not in messages or tool schemas.

The guardrail test `internal/plugin/cache_compliance_test.go` runs every
in-repo plugin twice over an identical request and asserts byte-identical
output, and asserts markers survive the round-trip. New plugins are picked up
by adding their name to the list — do so.

## 7. Tool-output safety

The trailing tool-result batch is evidence the model requested but has not yet
consumed. Keep it exact unless an explicit rule opts a recoverable tool into
deterministic `first_pass` reduction. Model-based compaction must always wait
for at least one exact exposure.

Unknown tools, mutation outputs, and failures default to exact. Historical
source reads need a recent exact window and a deterministic recovery marker;
economically gated transformations must be assessed as one batch from the
earliest changed item. Reuse the policy and cache-key helpers in `plugin-sdk`
rather than inventing plugin-specific matching or call-ID-only keys. See
[COMPACTION.md](https://github.com/torana-edge/torana-edge/blob/main/docs/COMPACTION.md) for the public contract.
